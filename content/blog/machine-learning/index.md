<p>Machine Learning is the latest <strong style="color:#ffc8dd">buzzword</strong> floating around so let's discuss the term machine learning in layman’s terms.</p>

<p>Now consider you are trying to score a goal from outside the penalty area…..
After the first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force into it and the ball missed the goal post. After the second attempt, you realize that the angle at which you shoot the ball is not the proper one and you need to change the position. What is happening here is basically after every shot we are learning something and improving the result. We are programmed to learn from our experience.

<p>
Suppose you decided to watch a movie on any of the ott platforms say Netflix and after you completed watching the movie or even before starting one, you might get some recommendation saying “Because you watched” you will get the list of movies from the same genre.

<p> This is a common use case of Machine Learning called “Recommendation Engine”.Netflix uses the personalized method where movies are suggested to the users who are most likely to enjoy them based on a metric like major actors or genre.<p>

* There are three main types of learning problems in machine learning:-
   ##### 1. Supervised learning
  <p>It is learning in which we teach or train the machine using data that is well labeled which means some data is already tagged with correct answers.
  </p>

   ##### 2. Unsupervised learning
  <p>It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention
  </p>

   ##### 3. Reinforcement learning
  <p>An RL agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being explicitly taught and it selects its actions on basis of its past experiences (exploitation) and also by new choices (exploration), which is essentially trial and error learning.

<p>We will further discuss all the above topics in great detail in my upcoming blogs. The topic for my next blog will be <strong style="color:#48cae4">"AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning"
